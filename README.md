# SCNTechnique example 

This is a recreation<sup>1</sup> of the last example from [my objc.io SceneKit article][article]. 

It's a fairly small two pass SCNTechnique that draws dark lines where there are "sharp" differences in depth or surface normals.

I don't intend for it to be anything more than an example, for learning purposes.
